/// Shared rather than repeated per handler so that truncation stays
/// distinguishable everywhere. The generic phrasing ("no response received")
/// is a lie for a truncated call — the model did answer, it just ran out of
/// budget partway — and that difference decides what to do next: a truncated
/// call is worth retrying or asking for less, whereas a 401 never is. Both
/// still map to 502 for the client, since either way this service could not
/// produce the answer it promised.
///
/// # What `tokens_used` means, and does not
///
/// Only truncation reports a real figure. The provider returns `usage` for a
/// truncated completion exactly as it does for a finished one, and that number
/// matters: measurement has shown a truncated call spending its entire budget,
/// almost all of it on reasoning that never reached the output. Recording zero
/// there would make the most expensive kind of failure the one that looks free.
///
/// For the rest, zero is the honest figure for a different reason in each case,
/// and in one of them it is not really a figure at all:
///
/// - [`LLMError::Network`] — nothing arrived, and a request that never reached
///   the provider is not billed. Zero is true.
/// - [`LLMError::Http`] — a rejected request (401, 429) is not billed, and the
///   provider's error bodies carry no `usage` regardless. Zero is true.
/// - [`LLMError::Parse`] — **zero here means "unknown", not "free".** The body
///   did not match the schema, so whatever `usage` it may have held could not
///   be read; a 2xx with an empty body (which has happened — see
///   `docs/gotchas.md`) may well have been billed. Distinguishing the two would
///   need a nullable column, which is a schema change and not this function's
///   to make. Until then, the accompanying `placeholder` says plainly that the
///   call failed, so nobody reading the row mistakes it for a free success.

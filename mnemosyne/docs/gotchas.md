# Mnemosyne Engineering Gotchas

Project-specific pitfalls discovered during development. Each entry exists so
future prompts (potentially with a different AI agent, or the same agent
without this conversation's context) don't silently regress a fix that was
painful to diagnose.

### The problem (as it was)

sqlx by default prepares named statements (`sqlx_s_1`, `sqlx_s_2`, ...) and
caches them per connection. Supabase's connection pooler (Supavisor /
PgBouncer in transaction mode, port 6543) does NOT guarantee that a given
client-side "connection" maps to the same Postgres backend connection across
transactions — the pooler may route subsequent statements on the same logical
sqlx connection to a different backend.

When that happens, the new backend still has the prepared statement name
registered from a previous occupant of that backend slot, so the next
`PARSE` of the same name on that backend fails with:

```
ERROR: prepared statement "sqlx_s_N" already exists
```

sqlx wraps this as a `DatabaseError` and surfaces it to the handler; without
explicit mapping it bubbles up as an unhandled 500.

### The symptom

Intermittent HTTP 500 responses with a JSON body like:

```json
{"error":"database error: error returned from database: prepared statement \"sqlx_s_1\" already exists at line 409"}
```

The intermittency is the giveaway: it depends on whether the pooler happens
to route a follow-up query to the same backend that prepared the statement
originally. A handler tested once in isolation may pass; the second invocation
on the same sqlx connection (e.g., the duplicate-email path that does an
`INSERT` both times) is much more likely to collide.

### The fix

Call `.persistent(false)` on every `sqlx::query`, `sqlx::query_as`, and
`sqlx::query_scalar` call made against this database:

```rust
sqlx::query_as::<_, UserRow>("INSERT INTO users (...) VALUES (...) RETURNING ...")
    .persistent(false)              // <-- required for Supabase pooler
    .bind(...)
    .fetch_one(pool.get_ref())
    .await
```

With `persistent(false)`, sqlx uses `StatementId::UNNAMED` (the unnamed
prepared statement) and skips the cache (see
`sqlx-postgres/src/connection/executor.rs` lines 31-37 and 184 in v0.9.0).
The unnamed statement is cleaned up by Postgres at the end of each
transaction, so no name collision can occur across backend reassignment.

This is also the workaround recommended in sqlx's own crate docs
(`sqlx-core/src/query.rs`, `query()` doc, line 538-540): *"Some third-party
databases that speak a supported protocol, e.g. CockroachDB or PGBouncer that
speak Postgres, may have issues with the transparent caching of prepared
statements. If you are having trouble, try setting `.persistent(false)`."*

### What does NOT work

- **`PgConnectOptions::statement_cache_capacity(0)`**: relies on the same
  underlying `persistent` flag in the executor; setting the cache capacity to
  0 alone does not prevent sqlx from preparing a *named* statement on the
  first miss. Verified empirically in Prompt 2 — the same `sqlx_s_N already
  exists` error recurred after applying only this change.
- **Direct-connection URL (`db.<project>.supabase.co:5432`)**: avoids the
  pooler entirely and removes the issue, but Supabase's direct host resolves
  only to IPv6 (AAAA record) as of 2026-07-04, and many dev environments have
  no IPv6 routing. The pooler URL (`aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543`)
  has IPv4 and is what Supabase themselves recommend for application
  connections.

### Rule going forward

The old checklist required `.persistent(false)` on every query and said the
requirement could be relaxed only if the pooler was switched off, by an
explicit decision recorded here. That switch has now happened, and this is
that record:

- Mnemosyne runs against a direct Postgres connection. New `sqlx::query*`
  calls need **no** `.persistent(false)`; write them plainly.
- If a transaction-mode pooler is ever introduced between the backend and
  Postgres, everything above applies again — reinstate `.persistent(false)`
  on every query and update this status banner.

### Where this was discovered

- **Prompt:** Milestone 2, Prompt 2 (CRUD endpoints for users, study_sets, cards)
- **Date:** 2026-07-05
- **First failing endpoint:** `POST /users` with a duplicate email (a second
  INSERT hitting the same cached statement name on a freshly-rotated backend
  connection).
- **PR / commit:** `feat: add minimal CRUD endpoints for users, study_sets, cards`
  (`71ca228`)
- **Affected files at time of fix:** `backend/src/main.rs` (the `/health/db`
  scalar query) and `backend/src/handlers/{users,study_sets,cards}.rs` (all
  six CRUD query calls).

### Where this was retired

- **Date:** 2026-08-27, when Mnemosyne moved off Supabase onto the local
  Postgres cluster shared with the Knowledge Store. All 38 `.persistent(false)`
  calls across nine files and the `statement_cache_capacity(0)` option in
  `main.rs` were removed in that change.

## 2. DeepSeek reasoning tokens: truncation is non-deterministic, and often arrives with partial content

`deepseek-v4-flash` is a reasoning model. Reasoning tokens are billed against
the completion budget but never appear in `choices[0].message.content`, so a
call that runs out of budget comes back looking like an ordinary response that
merely happens to be empty — or, worse, cut off mid-sentence. Only
`finish_reason` says otherwise. This is why every provider call is rejected as
`LLMError::Truncated` at the client boundary (`deepseek.rs::to_llm_response`)
instead of each handler checking for itself.

### Measured, not assumed

Same node, same prompt, same model, `temperature` unset — 10 identical calls at
each budget, run 2026-09-03 against the live API:

| `max_tokens` | truncated | reasoning tokens observed | truncated replies carrying partial content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200 | 10/10 | 200 (pinned at the ceiling) | 0/10 |
| 350 | 10/10 | 232 – 350 | 5/10 (up to 310 chars) |
| 500 | 8/10 | 78 – 500 | 2/8 |
| 650 | 7/10 | 162 – 650 | 2/7 |

Two things follow, and they pull in opposite directions:

**Reasoning consumption is wildly non-deterministic on identical input.** At
`max_tokens=650` the same request spent anywhere from 162 to 650 reasoning
tokens — a 4× spread with nothing varying on our side. Any logic that assumes a
prompt has a stable cost is wrong.

**A truncated reply frequently contains text.** Half the truncated calls at
`max_tokens=350` returned real, non-empty content — a half-written JSON object.
Handed to a parser, that reports a formatting error and sends whoever reads it
looking at the prompt instead of at the budget. This is the concrete failure the
`finish_reason` check prevents, reproduced deliberately rather than argued for.

There is a third shape, quieter than either, that the table above cannot show:
the model closes its brackets and *then* runs out. The content parses cleanly
and reports no error at all — it is simply **short**, three items where five
were asked for. Nothing downstream would notice. This is why the rule is that
the token budget outranks parseability: a truncated reply is discarded, never
salvaged, however well-formed it looks. Only `finish_reason` distinguishes it,
which is why it is read before the content ever is.

### Is retrying a truncated call worth anything?

Only near the boundary. Well below it (`max_tokens` 200 and 350) retrying the
same input succeeded **0 times in 20**. In the marginal band (500, 650) the
variance is enough to get through on **2–3 attempts in 10**. So neither
absolute is right: "truncation always repeats" is false, and "just retry" is
false too. One or two retries are worth it at most; the reliable fix is to give
the call more budget or ask it for less.

Note that Mnemosyne sends **no** `max_tokens` at all — the model's own default
applies. Truncation in normal operation therefore means reasoning consumed that
entire default, which is far outside the band measured here. There is no
measurement for that regime; do not assume these retry odds carry over to it.

### How to reproduce

The client sends no `max_tokens`, so it cannot be lowered from outside. Add the
field to `ChatCompletionsRequest` temporarily, or call the API directly with the
prompt `handlers::cards_from_node::build_prompt` produces. Do not commit a
hardcoded budget — the absence of one is deliberate.

## 3. DeepSeek can answer HTTP 200 with an empty body

Observed once, live, on 2026-09-03 at 15:07:58. A `POST /cards/from_node` call
came back with a success status and **zero bytes** of body. The client did the
right thing — `check_status` passes a 2xx, `serde_json` then fails on nothing at
all — and the failure surfaced as:

```
parse error: EOF while parsing a value at line 1 column 0; body snippet:
```

The empty `body snippet:` is the tell, and the reason error messages carry one.
Without it this reads as a JSON formatting problem and sends whoever is
debugging to look at the prompt.

### Why it is worth an entry

This is the "HTTP 200 with an error body" case in the project's standing bug
list, and this is the first time it has actually happened here. **A successful
status is not a successful response.** Any code path that treats 2xx as
permission to skip validation would have carried an empty string forward as if
it were the model's answer — and in a card generator, an empty answer that
reaches the review queue costs the learner a turn before anyone notices.

It is rare: one occurrence across every AI call this project has made. Do not
build retry logic specifically for it; do keep parsing strict, so that when it
happens the error names the emptiness instead of blaming the parser.

### Not to be confused with a client disconnect

The same incident was initially suspected of being caused by a caller (the
Knowledge Store's `card_sync`) timing out at 30s and dropping the connection
mid-request. That is not what happened, and the distinction was settled by
experiment: kill a client mid-call (`curl --max-time 2`) and the handler runs to
completion anyway — the card is created and written some seconds after the
caller is gone.

**Actix does not cancel a handler when the client disconnects.** Two
consequences follow. First, a dropped future could not have written the
`ai_interactions` row that recorded this error, so the row's existence rules the
theory out on its own. Second, a caller that gives up early does not stop the
work; it creates an *orphaned outcome* — the card exists here while the caller
recorded a failure. That is what the `existing_card_id` in the 409 body is for:
the caller's next attempt learns which card its earlier request produced, and
the two sides reconcile without anyone deleting anything.

## 4. Cards sourced from the Knowledge Store cannot be deleted one side at a time

Eight cards in the study set **"KS review"** (`27735bfe-…`) came from Knowledge
Store nodes via `POST /cards/from_node`, driven by KS's `card_sync` job. Six of
them — stellar evolution, Gödel's incompleteness theorem, the Sorites paradox,
Schrödinger's cat, the Ship of Theseus, the trolley problem — exist because KS
was deliberately hunting for a truncated LLM response on 2026-09-03, not because
any learner studied those concepts. They are coherent cards and they cost real
tokens; the provenance is recorded here only so that nobody later finds the
trolley problem in a physics learner's queue and assumes something went wrong.

**The trap, which applies to every KS-sourced card and not just these:** the two
sides must be deleted together or not at all.

- Delete the card here but leave the node in `ks.nodes`, and `card_sync`
  recreates it on its next hourly run. The deletion silently undoes itself.
- Delete the node in KS but leave the card here, and the card is orphaned: its
  `source_node_id` points at a row that no longer exists. Nothing enforces this —
  KS is a different database, so there is no foreign key to catch it (see the
  `cards_node_id_iff_knowledge_store` CHECK constraint, which is all the
  integrity that is available across that boundary).

So a cleanup is a two-sided operation, coordinated with whoever runs KS. A
one-sided one is not a smaller version of it; it is a different, worse outcome.
